I am an Assistant Professor in Physics at the California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly).

I have a bachelorâ€™s tree in Physics from the University of Dallas and a doctorate in Physics from the University of Chicago. For my dissertation I developed a technique for measuring the composition of cosmic rays using imaging Cherenkov telescopes, like VERITAS and TrICE.

At Cal Poly, I specialize in experimental particle astrophysics, searching for the highest energy neutrinos and cosmic rays. I started my more recent work on the radio detection of high-energy particles working on ANITA as a postdoc at the University of California, Los Angeles. I am also a member of the ARA collaboration. I also did a postdoc in science education at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, where I taught, developed curricula and exhibits, and worked with educators.

I have taught courses on intro electricity and magnetism, introductory particle physics, and labs in experimental physics and electronics.
