excerpt: "Exploring the extreme universe through particle astrophysics"
intro: 
  - excerpt: "We use cosmic rays and neutrinos to explore extreme physics at the largest and smallest scales. Flares, shocks, and other non-thermal processes accelerate these subatomic particles to the highest energies ever observed. These messenger particles carry with them information about the dynamics of their accelerator. We can also use these high-energy particles to explore fundamental physics interactions at energies beyond accelerators here on Earth.
  
  We currently use radio detection techniques to search for these rare particles. Cosmic rays and neutrinos generate fast radio sparks when they initiate showers in ice or air. Because of air and ice are both radio transparent, the particle showers can be detected from hundreds of kilometers away."
